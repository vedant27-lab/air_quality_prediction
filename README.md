<h1>Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning models. By leveraging various regression techniques, the project analyzes air pollution data and provides insights into air quality. The primary goal is to compare different machine learning models based on their performance metrics.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

<h1>Dataset</h1>
The dataset consists of air quality parameters collected over time, including pollutant levels, meteorological conditions, and other relevant factors. Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

<h1>Machine Learning Models Implemented</h1>
Four different regression models are implemented and compared based on their accuracy:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **XGBoost Regressor**

<h1>Implementation Steps</h1>
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the dataset.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Training different models and evaluating them using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.
4. **Comparison of Models**: Visualizing performance comparison of the models.

<h1>Model Comparison Visualization</h1>
A bar graph is generated to compare the models based on MAE and R² Score, showcasing which model performs the best for air quality prediction.

<h1>Results</h1>
The comparison helps determine the most effective model for air quality prediction. Insights gained from the analysis can be used for better pollution control strategies.

<h1>Future Improvements</h1>
- Incorporating deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Using real-time air quality data for dynamic predictions.
- Deploying the model as a web-based or mobile application.
